eboard-extras

theme pack 2
------------

eboard-extras contains new piece sets and sounds meant to be used in
the eboard chess board interface. But formats are standard (PGN for
graphics and WAV for sounds) and you can use it anywhere you please.
This pack 2 comes with 12 new piece sets and 10 sounds. The credits
for each piece set are given in the CREDITS file.

eboard 0.3.1 or newer is required.

To install:
./configure
(become root)
make install

This will basically copy all .png and .wav files in this directory to
the eboard data directory (detected with eboard-config --datadir ,
usually /usr/local/share/eboard or /usr/share/eboard) and append
the contents of the eboard_themes.conf in that directory with the
contents of extras2.conf that comes with this package.

The document Documentation/Themes.txt distributed with eboard
explains how eboard searches for themes, feel free to install the
files manually or only some of them if you want.

Should you upgrade eboard, it's installation may overwrite the
eboard_themes.conf file that lists the themes in this package.
In that case just install eboard-extras again.

In eboard, the piece sets will appear in the
Settings | Bitmapped Piece Sets sub-menus. (On 0.3.x).

The sound files will appear in the Settings -> Preferences -> Sound ->
Edit (any of the 3) dialog boxes in a drop down menu at the bottom.
This is valid for eboard 0.3.0 and later only.

The copying policy is GNU GPL. See the file COPYING for details.
The eboard web site is up at http://eboard.sourceforge.net.
